### Technology

I made a messenger app for users who love hip-hop to share new music out there or even promote themselves to get their name out. The languages and frameworks I used to make this app was Ruby on rails, javascript, jquery, bootstrap, and semantic-UI. 

### How I Made My Website

The first thing I started with was to make my models and relationships correctly. From their I made my authentication to work with registration and logging in. At this point I created all my view pages and put what I needed on each page. I then made the controller for the view page I would be working on. Then I would get my routes and made sure the routes were correctly going to the place I wanted it to go. I then just repeated the process multiple times then styled it.

### Installation

Once I finished my app, I pushed everything to master and heroku. I then was able to open my app on heroku successfully with all my styles and everything functioning perfectly.

### Unsolved

One thing that I really wanted to do in my app was actually have a like counter and dislike counter. This would allow me to find out who has the most likes on a video or track. Whoever has the most likes in a week would be on the homepage for that week to get his name out. Another cool feature I wanted to put was how many people were online.
